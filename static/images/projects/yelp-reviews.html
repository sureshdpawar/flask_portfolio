        <h1>Sentiment Analysis Of Yelp reviews using NLP </h1>

        <h2>Use Case: Sentiment Analysis</h2>
        <h3>Overview:</h3>
        <p>This project focuses on leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze sentiment in Yelp reviews. By parsing and interpreting the vast amounts of
            text data available on Yelp, the project aims to classify reviews into sentiment categories such as positive, negative, and neutral. This classification will help businesses
            understand customer feedback on a granular level, enabling them to improve service quality, address customer concerns more effectively, and tailor their offerings to meet customer needs better.</p>

        <h3>Scenario:</h3>
        <p>
            A local restaurant chain seeks to enhance its customer service and menu offerings based on customer feedback available on Yelp. The chain's management team decides to implement
            an automated system to aggregate and analyze customer reviews across different outlets to identify common themes in customer satisfaction and complaints. Using sentiment analysis, the system
            categorizes each review's sentiment, allowing the team to prioritize areas for improvement, such as food quality, service, or ambiance. Additionally, the analysis reveals unexpected insights,
            such as particular dishes that are consistently praised or criticized, guiding menu development and marketing strategies.
        </p>

        <h3>Technologies Used:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>NLP (Natural Language Processing): For preprocessing and transforming text data into a suitable format for model training.</li>
            <li>Transformers: Leveraged for accessing pre-trained NLP models and tokenizers, the Transformers library by Hugging Face provides a collection of state-of-the-art models such
                as BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) that are highly effective for sentiment analysis tasks.</li>
            <li>Python: The primary programming language used for implementing algorithms and data processing.</li>
            <li>PyTorch:  powerful open-source machine learning library used for building and training the neural networks required for sentiment classification.</li>
            <li>Jupyter Notebook: An interactive computing environment to document the code, results, and analysis comprehensively.</li>
            <li>BeautifulSoup: This library parses HTML and XML documents, enabling the collection of relevant textual data needed for sentiment analysis.</li>
        </ul>
